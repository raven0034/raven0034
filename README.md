## Hello! I bring good news! It is not the Dacia Sandero, but it is my GitHub profile

I mess around with a variety of challenges depending on what piques my interest at the time. Programming and developing community skills is a lot of FAAFO, but from a silly teen to now (over 10 years!), I've covered a broad range of problems and projects, public and private, in languages like Python, Java, C, C++ and more, as well as dabbling in some other languages like Rust most recently!

More to come!
